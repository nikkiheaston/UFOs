## Summary
One of the drawbacks of the design of this webpage is that the search boxes are case sensitive. For example, searching by state using "OR" will return no search results vs. "or" which returns 3 results. 

Two recommendations for further webpage development:
1. Correct the drawback stated above and allow input into the search boxes to be any case. 
2. Add a button in the filter section that allows the user to reset the search results.
