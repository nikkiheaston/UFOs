# UFOs

## Purpose
The purpose of this webpage is to filter a data table of UFO sightings by search parameters entered by a user into searches boxes. 

## Results
This webpage can be used to filter search results by the following categories:
 - date
 - city
 - state
 - country
 - UFO shape

Simply enter a phrase into one of the search boxes, following the format of the placeholders, and press the "enter" key. You can also enter multiple search criteria as well, as shown in the screenshots below. 

In this example, the search boxes for state and shape were used. Searching by California, or "ca", and the shape "light" returns the following table:

## Summary
One of the drawbacks of the design of this webpage is that the search boxes are case sensitive. For example, searching by state using "OR" will return no search results vs. "or" which returns 3 results. 

Two recommendations for further webpage development:
1. Correct the drawback stated above and allow input into the search boxes to be any case. 
2. Add a button in the filter section that allows the user to reset the search results.
